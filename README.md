A terminal based (CLI) application allowing users to easily create and manage a list of categorized notes

Time to get hands on with Node.js development! Today, youâ€™ll begin a multi-day build of a command-line (Terminal-based) note taking application.

This begins the first of a 4-part build of an application called Notesy. Today, our goal will be to get the basic wiring of the application in place, ensuring that our notes app can receive user input (a note) and provide some basic output in response.
